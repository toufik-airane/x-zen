# x-zen Privacy Policy

Effective date: August 24, 2026

x-zen has one purpose: make the desktop X.com feed calmer and easier to focus
on. It removes selected interface elements and promoted posts, centers the
feed, limits rapid refreshes, and adds optional focus tools.

## Data x-zen handles

- **X.com page content:** x-zen processes X.com page structure, interface
  labels, short text excerpts, and visible article titles locally in the
  browser. This content is used only for interface cleanup and outline
  navigation labels. x-zen does not store or transmit posts, messages,
  account details, article titles, or other X.com content.
- **Location:** only after the user selects **Share approximate location**, the
  browser gives x-zen the device location. x-zen rounds latitude and
  longitude to two decimal places before sending them over HTTPS to Open-Meteo
  to request local weather. The same rounded coordinates are sent over HTTPS
  to BigDataCloud's reverse-geocoding service to look up an approximate city
  name (for example "Paris FR") shown on the weather card. If that lookup
  fails, weather still works and the city label is simply omitted. x-zen does
  not store the exact or rounded coordinates, and the city name is kept only
  in the local weather cache described below.
- **Extension settings:** feed width and interface preferences are stored with
  Chrome synchronized storage. Google can synchronize these values when Chrome
  Sync is enabled.
- **Focus, sound, and weather state:** the Pomodoro state, optional hourly-bell
  preference, and latest weather result (including the approximate city name)
  are stored locally in Chrome. The hourly-bell preference lives in Chrome's
  session storage and resets when the browser session ends. Cached weather is
  treated as stale after 30 minutes and is then updated while weather remains
  enabled. The cache contains conditions, temperatures, and the approximate
  city name, not coordinates. The bell is a bundled local file and makes no
  network request.

## Data sharing

Rounded coordinates are sent only to Open-Meteo (weather forecast) and to
BigDataCloud (approximate city lookup) when the user enables or updates
weather. Open-Meteo can process the request IP address and coordinates under
its [Terms and Privacy policy](https://open-meteo.com/en/terms), which states
that API server logs can be retained for up to 90 days. BigDataCloud processes
the request under its [privacy policy](https://www.bigdatacloud.com/privacy/).
No other user data is sold, shared, or transferred. x-zen has no advertising,
analytics, user accounts, or developer-operated server.

## Retention and deletion

x-zen keeps settings and feature state only in Chrome storage. Turning weather
off in its card deletes the cached result and stops automatic updates. Users
can delete all extension data by removing the extension or by clearing its
stored data in Chrome. Open-Meteo and BigDataCloud control retention of their
own server logs under their respective policies.

## Security

Weather requests use HTTPS. x-zen does not execute remote code. All extension
logic is included in the installed package.

## Limited Use

The use of information received from Google APIs will adhere to the Chrome Web
Store User Data Policy, including the Limited Use requirements. Data is used
only to provide x-zen's disclosed user-facing features. It is not used for
advertising, credit decisions, sale, or unrelated purposes, and humans are not
permitted to read user data.

## Changes and contact

Material changes to these practices will be disclosed in the extension before
the changed handling begins. Questions can be sent through the support contact
on the x-zen Chrome Web Store listing.

x-zen is an independent extension and is not affiliated with X Corp.,
Open-Meteo, or BigDataCloud.
